## Color Schemes
The <i>swing states</i> are bordered in black.  You can toggle between a Neutral and a Partisan color scheme.

| Partisan                                | Neutral                                       |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ![Partisan](img/Partisan.png)           | ![Neutral](img/Neutral.png)                   |
| yellow - grey - yellow                  | red - grey - blue                             |
| Brighter the yellow, the more skew      | The more blue, or red, the more skew that way |
| Hide party but show skew                | Reveal party but skew harder to equate        |

## A Plea and a Warning
<span style="color:red;">WARNING: the data is currently random!</span> You can help by providing the data.
Ideally, with the url from which the data was obtained and by what means.  Even if you can't figure out
how to scrape it out of the source, perhaps I can help with that...
